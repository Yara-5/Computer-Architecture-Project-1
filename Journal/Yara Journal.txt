Nov 23, Control Hazards: Branch Flush Implemented - Complete Pipelined Implementation. Finalized logic for flushing instructions upon taken branches or jumps (Control Hazard Resolution).

Nov 22, Structural Hazards / Stalling: Correct Single Memory and Correct Stalling implemented. Finalized logic to handle the structural hazard posed by the Single Memory unit, and associated Load-Use stalls.

Nov 20, Data Hazards / Memory: Correct Forwarding implemented. Single Memory file added. Addressed initial issues with Single Memory and data forwarding paths.

Nov 19, Data Hazards: Forwarding Implemented. Initial logic for detecting and resolving data hazards added. Minor fixes applied.

Nov 18, Pipelining Transition: Pipeline Registers Implemented. Began structural transition from single-cycle to 5-stage pipeline by adding pipeline registers between stages.

Nov 17, Pipelining Transition: Continued work on implementing pipeline registers.

Nov 16, Single Cycle Baseline: Single Cycle fixes. Final refinements and debugging of the single-cycle base design before moving to pipelining.
